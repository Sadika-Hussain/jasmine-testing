# Testing with Jasmine 
Both the Calculator and Tip Pool projects include **.test** files written in Jasmine, a JavaScript testing framework. These files contain test cases for each function in Calculator and Tip Pool, ensuring the correctness of both programs and identifying any bugs or errors.
## Running the Tests
Jasmine files are included using a CDN, so there's no need for installation. Users can simply open the project files in a browser and Jasmine will automatically execute the test suites and display the results directly in the browser window.
